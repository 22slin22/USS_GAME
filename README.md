# Ultra-Sonic school Game

## The Project

The project is a fun game based on an ultrasonic sensor. It measures the distance to the player standing in front of the device. The player then has to walk forward and backward to follow a given graph. There are many different functions to choose from (e.g. linear, quadratic, sine, ...) which are transformend randomly each round. The score is dependened on the accureecy with which the player traced back the given graph.

The entire code runs on a Raspberry Pi.
